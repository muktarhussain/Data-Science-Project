This capstone project is a part of IBM Data Science Specialization at Coursera. Other DSWG projects can be found at 
the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/muktarhussain/Data-Science-Project).

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to build a model that can predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. 
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward 
of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine 
if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company 
wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch. In this project, we will collect and make sure the data is in the correct 
format from an API.
